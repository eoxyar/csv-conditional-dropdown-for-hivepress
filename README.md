WP Plugins
The new version v18 , is installable plugin, fully functional, manageable in admin side.
The first version must unzip first. There are 2 earlier test versions.
Adding 2 cols conditional dropdown in listing submit page/
Contain some "cosmetics" of the first version making more universal.
I continued with this selector to see how many lines
it reads in a reasonable time or if it is
an option if we have an attribute with thousands of options.
I wonder which is more efficient, faster.
I leave it to you to continue testing it, maybe it is good for something.

In wp settings>location-selector
/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=location-selector-settings

you will find the location selector where you can change
the display areas for the attributes and change the labels,
you can also choose which .csv file you want to use.
The .csv file is located in this plugin folder.

Hope selector js work well for you and do not cuasing page reload
Use  pagerefresh.js if you want to populate cities according county after category is changed in the form filling process and need reselect them.
IMPORTANT ===== do not let spaces beetwen text in your csv file use  "-"  or  "_"  and also special characters  are prohibited like ' .
